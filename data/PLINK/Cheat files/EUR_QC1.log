Warning: 1806 het. haploid genotypes present (see EUR_QC1.hh ); many commands
treat these as missing.
Total genotyping rate in remaining samples is 0.999816.

Warning: --hwe observation counts vary by more than 10%, due to the X
chromosome.  You may want to use a less stringent --hwe p-value threshold for X
chromosome variants.
--hwe: 944 variants removed due to Hardy-Weinberg exact test.
